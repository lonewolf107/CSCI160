Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(n log n), with n representing the size of the input list. This is primarily because of the sorting operation, 
which is the dominant factor in determining the overall time complexity. 
While the subsequent iterations for summing elements contribute O(n), their impact is eclipsed by the sorting cost.

Space Complexity: Assuming in-place sorting, the space complexity is O(1). 
The extra space used for the `min` and `max` variables remains constant and does not increase with the size of the input list.
