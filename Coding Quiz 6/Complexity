Complexity of Time: O(n^2)
O(n^2) is the time complexity because of the nested loops. n-1 iterations make up the outer loop,
where n is the length of the input list arr. In the worst scenario, the inner while loop might 
execute for i iterations (where i is the outer loop's current index), resulting in an O(n^2) total time complexity.

O(1) for space complexity
Because the technique sorts the input list in-place rather than utilizing extra data structures that expand
with the size of the input, the space complexity is O(1).
