Time Complexity:
The outer loop runs from i = 1 to i = n, making n iterations.
Inside the outer loop, there are two inner loops. Both inner loops iterate from 1 to n for each value of i.
Therefore, the time complexity of each inner loop is O(n).
Since the inner loops are nested, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is determined by the additional space used by the program, excluding the input.
The program uses a constant amount of extra space for variables i, j, k, which does not depend on the input size.
Therefore, the space complexity of the program is O(1), which means it has constant space complexity.
