Plus minus complexity

1.Time Complexity:

The function iterates over each number in the arr list exactly once. The time complexity for this operation is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the arr.

Calculating and printing the ratios involve constant time operations and hence take O(1) time.

Overall, the dominant time complexity comes from iterating over the list. Thus, the Time Complexity is O(n).

2. Space Complexity:

The function uses constant extra space to store counters for positive, negative, and zero numbers (posCount, negCount, and zeroCount). 

The ratios (posRatio, negRatio, zeroRatio) also take up constant space.

No other data structures that scale with the input size are used in the function. Hence, the Space Complexity is O(1) (constant space).
